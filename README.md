# Face-Detection-Using-ML
● Importing essential libraries and reading an image from a specified path. The image is displayed using both Matplotlib and OpenCV for
verification.
● The image is resized to smaller dimensions to enhance processing speed and converted to grayscale, as face detection algorithms
typically require grayscale images.
● Face Detection Using Haar Cascade Classifier: Implementing the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in the image. Detected faces
are marked with rectangles, and additional parameters like scaleFactor and minNeighbors are adjusted to improve detection
accuracy.
● Exploring more sophisticated methods like HOG and Dlib's CNN-based face detectors for better accuracy and performance, especially
in varied lighting and complex backgrounds. These methods are compared and integrated into the overall face detection workflow
